# Proof of Concept for Frontline Mental Health App
Using sythnetic data this aims to provide proof of concept for the effect of events on mental health

A simple project I was asked to put together for the Department of Community Mental Health as proof of concept for a frontline app for improving the identification of Mental Health within the Royal Navy and Royal Marines.

At the time of writing the data collection method was being integrated into the MyNavy App.
